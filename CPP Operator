//First Problem Solution Code:
//Write a program to check whether two numbers (entered by user) are equal or not.

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){
    cout<<"Enter Two Numbers To Compare: ";
    int num1;
    int num2;

        cout<<"1";
    }
    else{
        cout<<"0";
    }

    return 0;

//Second Problem Solution Code:
//Write a program to take the values of two variables a and b from the keyboard and then check if
//both the conditions 'a < 50' and 'a < b' are true.

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){

//Third Problem Solution Code:
//There are 45 total pupils in the class, 25 of whom are boys. Write a program to find how many
//girls received grades "A" if 17 boys made up 80% of the students that received grades "A".

#include <iostream>

	g = total - b;        //number of girls getting grade A
	cout << "Number of girls getting grade A = " << g << endl;
	return 0;
}

//Fourth Problem Solution Code:
//Write a program to calculate the sum of the first and the second last digit of a 5 digit number.

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){
    int num;
    cin>>num;
    int x=0;
    int j=10;
    int sum=0;

//Fifth Problem Solution Code:
//Write a program to calculate the sum of digits of a 3 digit number.
